            <div>Im Jay. Im a California native currently living near San Francisco. I built this website with React.js as a passion project to show some of the things I am interested in. Its using ArangoDB on the back end and I'm hosting it on an old laptop just for fun. As a web developer, I have experience building full stack applications. I am currently working as a UI developer with United Software Corporation. I'm a Tottenham Hotspurs fan, Go Coys! Drop me a message if you'd like to connect. Let's get some coffee.</div>

            <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
                <p>      Prior to becoming a software engineer, I had spent several years taking pre-requisite work for a
                    Clinical Laboratory Science program, and after a 14 month hospital internship and 1 year in the field, I
                    realized that I had chosen the wrong path. I was working in one of the best hospitals in the state and
                    despite making a good salary, I was not satisfied with my work. Like many people before me, I decided to
                    make a career change and pursue software engineering. It was hard to say goodbye to my old career since it had been my dream
                    , but I knew if I stayed there I wouldn't be happy. Software engineering gave me a chance to regularly be introduced
                    to new and challenging concepts, and more growth opportunities for personal development and advancement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent 1 month self studying JavaScript while continuing to work full time, and after that month was over,
                    I quit my job and began self studying JavaScript full time. I interviewed for and was accepted into Hack Reactor Software Engineering
                    Immersive 12 week program on my first attempt, and 3 months later found myself on the job hunt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the front-end, I learned to write with JavaScript and make applications using React, HTML5, and CSS3. I also used libraries such 
                    as MaterialUI and Bootstrap to speed up development time. On the back-end, I used Node.js, Express.js, and several databases such as MySQL2.0, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, 
                    and ArangoDB. I also built one application using Socket.io. I have deployed both to cloud computing services
                    such as AWS as well as on private server computers using my home router. Other back end tools I have worked with include NGINX for load-
                    balancing, and k6 and Loader.io for stress testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I feel I have come so far in my journey, I know that is has only just begun, and I have a long ways to go. I hope that I can make a strong addition to the company
                    I work at, and join a team of individuals who are passionate about their work and about developing applications that are resilient,
                    scalable, and provide a great user experience with every component.
