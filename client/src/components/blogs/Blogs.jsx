One advantage is you will not be charged for memory usage or computing time. A disadvantage is your download and upload speeds can be limited by the plan you are signed up for with your ISP. The laptop would be running at all times and the electricity bill can increase. In either case, if you wish to register a domain name, you would still need to pay a yearly fee and end up paying some money in the end.
        The following steps were followed for a PC based deployment.
        1. Purchase domain name through Godaddy.
        2. Use Node.js installer to install Node.js and NPM. Choose carefully during installation to ensure NPM is added. https://nodejs.org/en/download/
        3. Install NVM for Windows. https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
        4. Install Git for Windows. https://git-scm.com/download/win
        5. Create directories and clone repository.
        6. Run installation commands are necessary for your server. ( npm install, npm run react-dev, npm run start to start server listening ).
        7. Find your personal computer IP address through checking Wifi connection settings. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/find-your-ip-address-in-windows-f21a9bbc-c582-55cd-35e0-73431160a1b9
        8. Edit inbound rules in Firewall to allow access through the port your server listens at ( 3000 in most cases ).
          9. The server is immediately reachable at your PCs IP address and port. ( http://192.168.0.24:3000/ )
        10. Finally, set up port forwarding on Godaddy using your personal computer IP address and port, so traffic arriving at your domain name is forwarded with masking to your IP address port. ( jayandthesky.me → http://192.168.0.24:3000/ ). Port forwarding can take 1 hour up to 48 hours to take effect.

                    Deploying a server on your old laptop offers advantages and disadvantages to deploying over a standard cloud based service like AWS or Azure. One advantage is you will not be charged for memory usage or computing time. A disadvantage is your download and upload speeds can be limited by the plan you are signed up for with your ISP. The laptop would be running at all times and the electricity bill can increase. Additionally, configuring a home server requires some knowledge of DNS, IPs, router settings, and port-forwarding. In either case, if you wish to register a domain name, you would still need to pay a yearly fee and end up paying some money in the end.

                    The following steps were followed for a PC based deployment.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      1. Purchase domain name through Godaddy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      2. Use Node.js installer to install Node.js and NPM. Choose carefully during installation to ensure NPM is added. https://nodejs.org/en/download/
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      3. Install NVM for Windows. https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      4. Install Git for Windows. https://git-scm.com/download/win
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      5. Create directories and clone repository.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      6. Run installation commands as necessary for your server. ( npm install, npm run react-dev, npm run start to start server listening ).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      7. The traffic routing design is as follows:
                Domain name --> (port-forwarded) --> Router public IPv4 --> (port-forwarded) --> Server computer private IPv4.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      8. Determine your server computers IP. Open up cmd in start menu, and enter 'ipcofig'. IPv4 is your server computers private address. Default gateway is your routers private address.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      9. Edit inbound rules in Firewall to allow access through the port your server listens at ( 3000 in most cases ).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      10. The server is immediately reachable on your WiFi at your IP address + port. ( http://192.168.0.24:3000/ )
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      11. Open up a port on your router. Log in to your routers GUI (instructions normally printed on the router). Otherwise, visiting the Default Gateway or 192.168.0.1 may allow you to connect to your router. Create a Port-forward to recieve connections on port 3000 and forward to your server computer address + port.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      12. Finally, set up a Port-forward with masking on Godaddy in your DNS settings to send traffic to your router public address + port. Visit https://www.whatismyip.com/ while connected to your Wifi to determine your routers public IP address. ( jayandthesky.me → http://67.161.47.190:3000/ ). Godaddy Port forwarding can take 1 hour up to 48 hours to take effect. Router Port Forward should take effect immediately.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                    Thats it! Your website is now up and running!
                  </p>
                  <p>Additional Notes:</p>
                  <p>While your routers private IP address is used to access the router GUI, the routers public IP address should be used in the Port-forward. </p>
                  <p>Your website can be accesssed several ways. While on the WiFi network, you may connect to your website through the server computer IP, router IP, or domain name. While off the WiFi network, you may connect to your website through the router IP or domain name. </p>
                  <p>Your server computer and router have public and private IP addresses which should not be mixed up. The private IP address is created for each device by your router in numerical order, with the router commonly starting at 192.168.0.0 or 192.168.0.1, and following devices in order (192.168.0.2, 192.168.0.3, 192.168.0.4, etc). All your devices, laptops, phones, Google Home, are all assigned a private IP address. A user not connected to your WiFi/local network is unable to reach your server computer via the private/local IP address.</p>
                  <p>Static IPs would benefit this walkthrough. If the server computer's private IP is ever reassigned by the router, you will need to use the router GUI to edit the Port-forward setting.</p>
