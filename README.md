## Description
This website began as a small project as part of the Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive. It originally began as a page to showcase aerial drone photography, since creating a personal website for photography would give me more power over visual demonstration. Eventually, it evolved into a home page for a personal website where I could host anything I am passionate about.
